# Schaukel-Experiment-Redesign

Signal value transfer script Using the microcontroller "Arduino Uno" and the programming language "Javascript". The values are then graphically displayed in real time on a LineChart with Chart.js.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

[Arduino StandardFirmata](https://github.com/firmata/arduino) - Firmata is a protocol for communicating with microcontrollers from software on a host computer. 

```
latest NodeJS
latest npm
```

### Installing

```
1. install NodeJS
2. install npm
3. Clone The Repository
4. open Terminal or Commandline 
5. Change to the directory with the script
6. execute "npm install" and then "npm rebuild"
7. Now you can run the script with "node start.js" and view the results via http://localhost:3000 and in Console
```

## Running the tests
